# Almiqdad Yahya Portfolio

A minimalist, mobile-responsive portfolio website for Mictad Yahya, theoretical physics graduate student. Inspired by christianbaun.com.

## Features
- Monochromatic dark blue and teal color scheme
- Modern sans-serif typography
- Fixed sidebar navigation
- Smooth scroll and section reveal animations
- About, Projects, Research, Vlog, and Contact sections
- Mobile responsive (flexbox)
- Social icons in footer

## Getting Started
Open `index.html` in your browser. No build step required.

## Customization
Replace placeholder images and update content as needed.

## Working with GitHub from this workspace

When you add or update binary assets (for example Open Graph images or project
thumbnails), create the pull request locally with Git rather than through the
lightweight editor UI. The command-line flow below works entirely from this
Codespaces/Codex terminal and pushes a branch you can use for a PR:

```bash
# 1. Make sure you are on the branch you want to base your work on
git checkout main

# 2. Create and switch to a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/collider-updates

# 3. Stage all changes, including binary assets
git add .

# 4. Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Describe your update"

# 5. Push the branch to GitHub
git push -u origin feature/collider-updates
```

After the push completes, open the repository on GitHub. You will see a prompt
to create a pull request from `feature/collider-updates`; all binary files that
were committed locally are included automatically. If the repository uses
GitHub Pages, merging the PR will redeploy the site.
